# Contributing to double-meh-sw

Thank you for your interest in contributing!

## Getting started

Clone and install:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uhop/double-meh-sw.git
cd double-meh-sw
npm install
```

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for the module map and dependency graph.

## Development workflow

1. Make your changes.
2. Lint: `npm run lint:fix`
3. Test: `npm test` (also `npm run test:bun`, `npm run test:deno`)
4. Type-check: `npm run ts-check` and `npm run js-check`

## Code style

- ESM (`import`/`export`) in all files.
- Formatted with Prettier — see `.prettierrc` for settings.
- Zero runtime dependencies; frameworks appear as devDependencies for conformance tests only.
- Keep `.js` and `.d.ts` files in sync for all modules under `src/`.
- Comments are _why_-markers only — never narrate what the code does.
